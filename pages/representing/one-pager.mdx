### Overview
One pagers are a type of media that helps you represent your complete idea in a simple way. They are meant to stand alone, meaning someone needs no additional information to understand what’s on the one-pager. Since a whole idea must fit into 1-2 pages, it forces you to explain the topic simply.

### The Process
1. Identify the key ideas you want to communicate
2. Pick a structure that best helps the reader understand your ideas
3. Fill in the structure with a mix of visuals and text

### My Experience
My Praxis II team used a one-pager to communicate our opportunity, its impact, our solution, how we have made an improvement and our next steps. **One unique aspect was the focus on how our solution actually made an improvement**. We picked this route after looking at past Praxis posters and constantly asking ourselves, why is this solution necessary? It seemed like some solution must already exist for their given opportunities.

import DisplayImg from '../../components/displayimg'
import one from "../../public/one-page.png";

<div style={{display: 'flex', gap: "5px"}}>
    <DisplayImg src={one} alt="Figure 1: A section of our one-pager that highlights where our solution is better than the status quo (in yellow)"/>
</div>

By comparing our solution to the status quo it makes it more clear that our solution is better at the given requirements. Upon reflection, one piece of information that is missing is why our solution is so much better. **Adding what the status quo design fails to consider would further help solidify confidence in our approach to the opportunity.** 

As a whole, the one-pager was useful for identifying the absolute core components of our engineering design work. This informed what content should absolutely be included in our presentation. I enjoy one-pagers because I believe technical jargon is useless. Being able to explain a concept simply (often from first principles) shows a much deeper understanding of the topic.

### Checklist
import Checkbox from '../../components/checkbox'

<Checkbox text={"Are you’re visuals clear and logical? Oftentimes, people will just skim the images and headings first. Communicating as much information in the images and headings will leave the reader with a strong direction of the one-pager before reading the rest."}/>
<Checkbox text={"Give you’re one-pager to someone who knows nothing about your project. Can they understand everything? What pressing questions are they left with? I only understood the importance of visuals after having my mom go over our team’s one-pager."}/>
